# **📝 TODO APP**

Hi! I'm **Prince Kesharwani**, and I built this TODO app to learn the fundamentals of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app utilizes **JavaScript's LocalStorage** as its database for storing tasks.

## 🌐 Deployed Link

You can try the app here: [Netlify Deployed Link](https://fabulous-fudge-4e8ec3.netlify.app/)

## 🚀 How to Use

- **Add Task:** Visit the deployed link and start adding your tasks.
- **View Tasks:** Your tasks will be displayed on the `Dashboard` page.

  - On the `Dashboard` page, you can see the total number of tasks.
  - There is also a sorting feature that allows you to organize tasks by `Priority`.

- **Move to Progress:** Once you're ready to work on a task, move it to the `Progress` page.

- **Mark as Done:** After completing a task, move it to the `Done` page, where all completed tasks are displayed.
